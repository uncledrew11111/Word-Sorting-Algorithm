# C++ Word Sorting Algorithm

## Problem

When dealing with really large text files like books, articles, or online discussions, it can take a long time to search for specific words and/or find how often they appear. A simple "scan through everything" approach becomes too slow as the file grows. We want to build a program that can store, search, and count words in a large dataset using efficient data structures.

## Motivation

Fast text search is essential for large data technology that handles massive amounts of text. These tools can better help readers quickly find any topic they are looking for in a text. Also, the more efficient they are (both memory and time wise), the less frustrating they are on the user's end (which is important from a business and social standpoint). Our goal is to find which data structure (Trie or Hash Table) offers faster lookups and better memory efficiency. This comparison will also help us understand how real-world search and autocomplete systems work.

## Features

We will know that we've solved the problem when:
- Our program can load and process at least 100k words from a dataset
- Both the Trie and the Hash Table versions can correctly insert and find words
- We can measure and compare build time, lookup time, and memory usage for both methods
- We can show word frequencies, display the top 10 most common words, and handle user searches instantly
- There is a good user experience for loading data, choosing a structure, and viewing results

## Data

Currently, we plan to use free public domain books from Project Gutenberg. These texts will contain well over 100,000 words.

**Link:** https://www.gutenberg.org/

The dataset will have two fields: word (string) for each token and line_number (integer) for the word's position in the text. Before inserting into the hash/trie, we will remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and split the text into individual words.

## Tools

**Language:** C++

**Libraries:** `<fstream>` for reading files, `<chrono>` for timing, `<iomanip>` for formatted output.

**Editor:** VS Code & CLion

## Visuals

*Wireframe concepts are subject to change. This is an initial proof of concept

## Strategy

We'll build and compare two data structures from scratch:

1. **Trie (Prefix Tree):** Stores each word letter by letter which makes prefix searches very fast.
2. **Hash Table:** Stores each word with a custom hash function and resolves collisions using chaining.

We'll store each word and how often it appears in both structures, then time how long it takes to insert and search. After that, we'll compare their speed and memory use, saving the results to see which one performs better.

## Building the Project

To compile and run the project:

```bash
make
```

To test the compiled program:

```bash
make test
```

To clean build files:

```bash
make clean
```

Commits are very important part of collaboration and should follow an agreed on convention for the team. Each commit also offers a way to organize the changes because it shows a very short concise description of the change made. As such, make sure to commit frequently and that each commit solves only one issue. As with Issues, your commits should be atomic (contains only one change, e.g. `Feat: implement user input parsing for calculator to split string into tokens (Issue #1)`).

##### Guidelines for good commit messages
1. Keep it **short** (less than 150 characters total)
    - Committing **fewer changes** at a time can help with this
2. Use the **imperative** mood
    - This convention aligns with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert
    - Consistency enhances speed of reading comprehension
    - Tends to be more concise than the other moods
3. Specify the **type of commit** (Link to [ISSUE](#issues)):
    - feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
    - fix: A bug fix
    - style: Feature and updates related to styling
    - refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
    - test: Everything related to testing
    - docs: Everything related to documentation
    - chore: Regular code maintenance.[ You can also use emojis to represent commit types]
4. Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
5. Do not end the subject line with a period
6. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
7. Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
8. Information in commit messages:
    - **Issue it fixes**
    - **Why** the change was made
    - **Where** the change was made
    - If it's a fix, describe the bug
9.  Be **CONCISE**.

##### Examples of Commit Messages:
- "." - Very Bad (What does this even mean?)
- "m" - Very Bad (Okay?)
- ":)" - Very Bad (I hope your team members understand what this means because I don't)
- "main function" - Bad (What about it?)
- "First commit" - Bad (Congratulations?)
- "Update main.cpp" - Better but still bad (What changed?)
- "added mergesort.h, will add std::chrono later" - A bit better (Future plans shouldn't be the main point of a message. What does this commit change?)
- "removed empty line from bottom of dictionary and updated UI" - Good (But stick to one change per commit)
- "added filter buttons to sort menu" - Very Good (Use imperative mood and capitalize the messages, but the content of the message is excellent)




#### Pull Requests

> "A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch." [About Pull Requests in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Once you've made commits and are done working on the feature your branch was for, you should make a pull request. A pull request is meant to allow your teammates to review your changes, give you feedback, and the merge all the functional code into one central location (main branch).

#### Undoing Commits, Pushes, Merges, etc.

If you've made a mistake (*happens to the best of us*) in the changes you've made and committed, pushed, or merged, you can undo the majority of those changes using Git CLI. This [guide](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html) allows you to interactively navigate through the resources based on the actions you've taken to find the solution for your problem.

## Markdown and README

README files are formatted using Markdown in GitHub. If you're not familiar with Markdown, or if you need some syntax information, you can find syntax and tips in [Markdown resource file](resources/MARKDOWN.md). In addition to README files being formatted using Markdown, you can use the same syntax in your commit messages, your issues, and milestones to format any text.
